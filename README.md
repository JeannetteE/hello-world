# hello-world

I am a Librarian - Happy in love with learning Data Science skills
GitHub being one of them.
In order to optain these skills I believe I need to use then on a regular basis, and since I am not trained as a software developer / CODER, I believe I need to adress the Librarian skills I have - and use GitHub for building website and such
keen on learning, any how:)
