# hello-world

I am a Librarian - Happy in love with learning Data Science skills, 
GitHub being one of them.
In order to optain these skills I believe I need to use them on a regular basis, and since I am not trained as a software developer / CODER, I believe I need to adress and master some of the Librarian skills that I have - and use GitHub for building website and such.

Very keen on lifelong learning, any how:)
